Files included are:

- dispersion.m
  A MATLAB m-file containing the function dispersion() and the subroutine dispersionFactors().
  Documentation on the use of the function is included in the file as comments.
  The subroutine dispersionFactors() requires the file dispersionFactors_PR29.mat, below.
  
- dispersionFactors_PR29.mat
  A MATLAB Data file containing pre-calculated values of normalised frequency, normalised velocity and factors M1 and M2 for a material with a Poisson's ratio of 0.29 (i.e. stainless steel).

- Dispersion.png
  An example of the dispersion of a trapezoidal stress wave using the phase and amplitude corrections used in dispersion.m
