# FRB simulation

# How to run?
Download all matlab scripts, then run 'chirp_moving.m'


# Script Description:
Script: FRB capture system simulation

Feature: Do digital signal processing for the input signal,find target FRB/chirp, save snapshot of the candidate

Script outline: 1.generate input signal; 2. Downsampling; 3.Use PFB to generate spectrum; 4.Moving average; 5.Incoherent-dedispersion; 6.Sum channels to find trigger; 7.Triggering and save snapshots.
